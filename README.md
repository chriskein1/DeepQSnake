# Deep Q Snake (WIP)

This project will focus on the Deep Q learning implementation using Tensorflow.js in the Snake React app Trevor Garnett and I made!

What we have right now:
- Fully implemented front-end Snake project
- Fully implemented simple Q algorithm (needs tweaking)
- Simple Q-learning Agent does train & improve, want better performance
- Neural network class using Tensorflow.js

TODO's:
- Implement primary and target networks to estimate Q values
- Replay buffer to create batches of data
- Train the networks
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters!

See snake_solver from Trevor Garnett for the fully implemented A* algorithm we worked on using VSCode Live Share
