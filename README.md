What we have right now:
Fully implemented front-end Snake project
Fully implemented simple Q algorithm (needs tweaking)
Neural network class

TODO's:
Implement primary and target networks to estimate Q values
Replay buffer to create batches of data
Fine tuning!

See snake_solver from Trevor Garnett for the fully implemented A* algorithm we worked on using VSCode Live Share
